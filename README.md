# Titanic-Survival-Prediction
Using Machine learning algorithm on the famous Titanic Disaster Dataset for Predicting the survival of the passenger. In this Repository my intention is to basically explain to every beginner . So this repository is for those who just begin their Machine Learning Journey. In this notebook i try to take down every single topic with a very naive approach so every beginner can grasp it very easily.
